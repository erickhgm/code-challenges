## Instructions

Given two strings, implement a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a
word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as `cinema`, formed from `iceman`. Only
consider characters, not spaces or punctuation. Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case.
